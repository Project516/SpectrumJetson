"""USB bandwidth report for the Jetson's cameras: what each camera reserves, what's failing, and how
to fix it. Run ON THE JETSON (no sudo needed; uses sudo -n for the kernel log if it can).

    scripts/jetson/usb-bandwidth.py          the report
    scripts/jetson/usb-bandwidth.py --json   the same, for scripts (health-check.sh)

Why cameras run out: a USB camera reserves isochronous bandwidth for the packet size of the
alternate setting it streams on, whatever it actually sends. The Jetson has one USB controller,
and every USB 2.0 port on it shares ONE budget: the four USB-A ports (one hub), the USB-C port, and
the M.2 Wi-Fi card's Bluetooth. Measured on 2026-09-24 with PhotonVision stopped: 6720 bytes per
125 us microframe fit (4 x 1280 on USB-A + 1600 on USB-C), 7400 didn't, whichever ports the cameras
were on. A camera that doesn't fit gets "Not enough bandwidth" from the kernel and never streams.

The fixes, in order:
  1. Cap cameras that have smaller alternate settings (our driver's payload_cap, set by
     11-uvcvideo-payload-cap.sh). At 1280 bytes (10 MB/s) an OV9281 at 1280x800 MJPEG still runs
     120 fps.
  2. Moving a camera to another port doesn't help. Lower the caps further, use fewer USB 2.0
     cameras, or use a USB 3 camera: those are on the USB 3 bus, which has its own budget.
  3. A camera with only one large alternate setting (the Razer Kiyo: 3 x 1020 bytes) can't be
     capped. It takes 3060 of the budget by itself.
