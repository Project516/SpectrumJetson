# FUEL game-piece models (2026)

The models we have for PhotonVision's TensorRT backend (`photonvision-14`), how they were made, and
which to use. Prepared 2026-09-24 by a Claude subagent; setup and usage are in the
[README](../README.md#game-piece-detection-tensorrt).

## Models

| | Wave Robotics 2826, YOLO11n | Project516, YOLO26n (v1) |

| Class | `object` (we label it `Fuel`) | `fuel` |
| Trained on | ~60 photos augmented to ~2,600, 640 px | ~53 phone photos, 640 px |

## Exports and engines

- **Exported on the laptop** with Ultralytics 8.4.161: `format=onnx imgsz=640 batch=1 dynamic=False opset=17 simplify=True`, plus an explicit `nms` setting.
  - The venv is `~/build/yolo/venv`, and the export script is `~/build/yolo/export_fuel.py`.
  - The ONNX files are in `staging/fuel-models/` (not in git) and `~/models` on the Jetson.
- **Engines are built on the Jetson** with `trtexec --fp16` (TensorRT 10.3, ~7–8 min each, no warnings). `scripts/jetson/12-install-yolo-model.sh` does this and installs the result.

| Variant | Output | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `*_raw` (`nms=None`) | `[1, 5, 8400]`: cx, cy, w, h, score (already sigmoid) | **Recommended.** Our runner does NMS, thresholds are tunable, and inference is fully async. |
| `*_nms` (`nms=True`) | `[1, 300, 6]`: x1, y1, x2, y2, score, class | Works (runner fallback). NMS is baked in (conf 0.25, IoU 0.7), and the CPU thread blocks for the whole inference. |
| `*_e2e` (YOLO26 `nms=False`) | `[1, 300, 6]`, all rows filled | **Avoid:** this checkpoint's NMS-free head missed a small ball and added false boxes (the same happens in PyTorch). |

**Checks:**
- The FP16 engine outputs match the FP32 ONNX outputs (box overlap ≥ 0.987).
- The raw and NMS variants found all 4 balls in 3 test photos.
- Those photos are probably Project516's training data, so this proves correctness, not accuracy.

**Speed** (`trtexec`, GPU compute, sharing the GPU with PhotonVision): 4.3–5.5 ms mean, 5.0–9.9 ms p99.
In PhotonVision the full pipeline (colour decode, letterbox, inference, NMS) ran at 76 fps uncapped;
we cap it at 30 fps.

## Which to use

- **Now:** `wave2826_yolo11n_fuel_raw`. It's installed on the Jetson as "Fuel (Wave 2826 YOLO11n)", and it's the model PhotonVision ships.
- **Next:** A/B it against `project516_yolo26n_fuel_v1_raw` (same input and output, ~17% fewer FLOPs, similar speed) on footage from our own colour camera. Rewind recordings are good for this.
- **By October:** fine-tune on our own camera's frames, with motion blur, bumpers and yellow distractors, and keep the 640 input. Through an ultrawide lens, a ball 5 m away is only ~9 px wide at 640.
- **Rebuild the engines** from the ONNX after any JetPack or TensorRT change. Engines only run on the TensorRT version and GPU they were built for.
